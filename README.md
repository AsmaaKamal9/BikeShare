# Python Script Project to Explore US Bikeshare Data
This Python 3 script is written to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and computes descriptive statistics from the data. It is run from the terminal (or from Jupyter notebooks).

This script is written in Python 3 and uses pandas, datetime, time, and csv packages. You will need all of these packages and Python 3 to be able to launch the script. Launch the bikeshare.py file from your terminal and you will see a prompt that will guide your experience reviewing the bikeshare data and reading relevant data analysis.


# Datasets

The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. Some data wrangling to reduce columns and reformat, has been performed to condense these files to the core six columns used in this project. This makes the analysis and the evaluation in this project more straightforward.

The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:

- Start Time
- End Time
- Trip Duration (in seconds)
- Start Station
- End Station
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year
